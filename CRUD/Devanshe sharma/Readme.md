## App Overview:
Welcome to quiz app project! This app is designed to challenge users with a series of multiple-choice questions on various topics. Users will test their knowledge and receive instant feedback on their answers. The app will keep track of the score and provide a final result at the end of the quiz.

## Technology and API:
Quiz app using vanilla JavaScript, which means we won't rely on any external libraries or frameworks. To populate our app with trivia questions,I'm using the Open Trivia DB API, which provides a vast collection of questions across different categories and difficulty levels.

## API Integration:
Throughout this project,this guide you through the process of making API requests using JavaScript's fetch function. You'll learn how to retrieve question data from the API, parse the JSON response, and dynamically generate the quiz interface.

## App Features:
